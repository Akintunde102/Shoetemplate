This template is for a small scale shoe company
It's built with html and php with a working php contact page
You can edit the php details like store/inc.php

Don't use those shoes. they aren't meant for you.I am just saying that you should endeavour to replace the shoes in the product section with your own products

To get across to me: I'm here at jegedeakintunde@gmail.com  and my website is @ http://akin.com.ng

Also, to let you know, the PNGS are Fireworks PNG, I mean they are editable in FIREWORKS

LOBATAN!!!!
