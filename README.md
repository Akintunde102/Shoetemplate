This template is for a small scale shoe company
It's built with html and php with a working php contact page
You can edit the php details like store/inc.php

Don't use those shoes. they aren't meant for you.
I am just saying that you should endeavour to replace the shoes in the product section with your own products

To get across to me: I'm here at jegedeakintunde@gmail.com  and my website is @ http://akin.com.ng

Also, to let you know, the PNGS are Fireworks PNG, I mean they are editable in FIREWORKS

LOBATAN!!!!
